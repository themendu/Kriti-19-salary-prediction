# Kriti-19-salary-prediction
Kriti(Annual inter hostel technical competition) hosted a competition to predict salary of undergraduate students using their real life data given.I have posted my top scoring model at the competition.


I have attached my code file along with the training and test set files.
I have chosen r2-score as my evaluation metric.
I have initially taken look at each and every variable first trying to clean it.
Followed by data preproccessing like imputing or removing missing values and then one hot enccoding of the variables
Followed by normalization and fine tuning my model and finding a [highest r2-score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.r2_score.html).
More details in the attached iPython Notebook.
